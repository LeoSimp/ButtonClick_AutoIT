# ButtonClick_AutoIT
Auto click windows GUI button by AutoIT code. And can set the exe title , text and ButtonID to meet different exe auto click reqiurment
For sometimes the buttonID is dymatic, we cannot set a buttonID anymore, but we can get all of buttonID and set conditions and keywords to search the right buttonID that we want, this is called auto get buttonID. But there is a requirement that the dymatic must have the common kewords, otherwise we can not define a keword to search.
